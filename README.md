# Use-Google-Maps-API-to-Visualize-BigQuery-Geospatial-Data-Add-to-favorites-Help
In this project we will make a web page where user can view all the record data through some specified area on map using heat map and also user can fire query using BigQueryAPI and view the data in some shapes.
I will be using google Maps API for this which will be valid only to my use so, if you want to try this then you have to get the API here.
Also in this I am using OAUTH 2.0 to authorize the user to view the BigQuery datasets.
